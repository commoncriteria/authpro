  <sec:Overview>
	This Functional Package for Authentication Protocols gathers requirements for several 
	protocols and standards that are commonly used in NIAP Protection Profiles for authentication
	in network communications. It includes requirements for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), 
	requirements for the composition and exchange of pre-shared keys (PSK), and requirements for X.509 
	certificates. These protocols and standards are often used in setting up trusted channels,
	but may also be used for other purposes, such as authenticating wireless communications.<h:p/>
	More specialized protocols, such as 802.1X, RADIUS, Enrollment over Secure Transoort (EST), and 
	Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) are not currently included. <h:p/>
	This Functional Package is organized as a collection of requirements so that a Security Target can
	claim one or more "base requirements." Additional SFRs must be claimed based on dependencies in the 
	intially claimed SFRs.

<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation	-->
<!--			-->
    <sec:toes title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
		The Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this Functional Package (FP) is an IT product that 
		uses pre-shared keys, X.509 certificates, or the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
		Typically these protocols would be used in products that implement trusted channels or VPNs for 
		communications with other IT entities, or implement wireless security protocols. This FP describes 
		the security functionality of these protocols and standards in terms of <xref g="CC"/>. 
		<h:p/>
		The contents of this FP must be appropriately incorporated into a PP, cPP, or PP-Module. When this Package 
		is so incorporated, the ST must include selection-based requirements in accordance with the selections or 
		assignments indicated in the incorporating document.
		<h:p/>
		The PP, cPP, or PP-Module that instantiates this Package must typically include the below components in order
		to satisfy dependencies of this Package. It is the responsibility of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module author who 
		incorporates this FP to ensure that dependence on these components is satisfied, either by the TOE or by 
		assumptions about its Operational Environment.
		<h:p>An ST must identify the applicable version of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module and this
		Functional Package in its conformance claims.</h:p>

	    Although focused on IPsec, this Package contains requirements for several authentication protocols used by
		IPsec IKE protocols. If the TOE does not implement IPsec, but
	    it does implement one of the other protocols, then this Package can be used to integrate requirements for the other protocols
	    into the ST.

					This use case adds physical protections to the base requirements for server-class hardware.
					Additional physical protections are required because the platform us assumed to be minimally

					FIA_X509_EXT.1.1 lists the rules for validating certificates. The ST author shall select whether
					revocation status is verified using OCSP or CRLs. FIA_X509_EXT.2 requires that certificates are
					used for HTTPS, TLS, and DTLS; this use requires that the extendedKeyUsage rules are verified.
					If OCSP is not supported the EKU provision for checking the OCSP Signing purpose is met by 
					default.<h:p/>
					This requirement is included if the protocol(s) selected in FTP_DIT_EXT.1.1 require the use of
					certificates. If the TOE implements TLS as a HTTPS/TLS server with no mutual authentication,
					this requirement is not applicable.<h:p/>
					OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling only support TLS server certificate validation. If other 
					certificate types are validated, either OCSP or CRL should be claimed.<h:p/>
					Regardless of the selection of "<h:i>implement functionality or invoke platform-provided 
					functionality</h:i>," the validation is expected to end in a trusted root CA certificate in a root
					store managed by the platform.

						The tests described must be performed in conjunction with the other certificate services evaluation 
						activities, including the functions in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. The tests for the extendedKeyUsage rules are 
						performed in conjunction with the uses that require those rules. If the application supports chains of
						length four or greater, the evaluator shall create a chain of at least four certificates: 
						the node certificate to be tested, two Intermediate CAs, and the self-signed Root CA. If 
						the application supports a maximum trust depth of two, then a chain with no Intermediate
						CA should instead be created.
						<testlist>
							<test>
								The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid certification path results in the function 
								failing, for each of the following reasons, in turn:<h:ul>
								<h:li>by establishing a certificate path in which one of the issuing certificates is not a CA certificate,</h:li>
								<h:li>by omitting the basicConstraints field in one of the issuing certificates,</h:li>
								<h:li>by setting the basicConstraints field in an issuing certificate to have CA=False,</h:li>
								<h:li>by omitting the CA signing bit of the key usage field in an issuing certificate, and</h:li>
								<h:li>by setting the path length field of a valid CA field to a value strictly less than the certificate path.</h:li>
								</h:ul>
								The evaluator shall then establish a valid certificate path consisting of valid CA certificates, and demonstrate that the 
								function succeeds. The evaluator shall then remove trust in one of the CA certificates, and show that the function fails.
							</test>
							<test>
								The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating an expired certificate results in the function failing.
							</test>
							<test>
								The evaluator shall test that the TOE can properly handle revoked certificates-“conditional on whether
								CRL, OCSP, OCSP Stapling or OCSP Multi-stapling is selected; if multiple methods are selected, then
								the following tests shall be performed for each method:
								<h:ul>
								<h:li>The evaluator shall test revocation of the node certificate.</h:li>
								<h:li>The evaluator shall also test revocation of an intermediate CA certificate (i.e. the intermediate
									CA certificate should be revoked by the root CA), if intermediate CA certificates are supported.
									If OCSP stapling per RFC 6066 is the only supported revocation method, this test is omitted.</h:li>
								<h:li>The evaluator shall ensure that a valid certificate is used, and that the validation function 
									succeeds. The evaluator then attempts the test with a certificate that has been revoked (for each 
									method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate is no longer valid that the 
									validation function fails.</h:li>
								</h:ul>
							</test>
							<test>
								If any OCSP option is selected, the evaluator shall configure the OCSP server or use a
								man-in-the-middle tool to present a certificate that does not have the OCSP signing purpose and verify
								that validation of the OCSP response fails. If CRL is selected, the evaluator shall configure the CA 
								to sign a CRL with a certificate that does not have the cRLsign key usage bit set, and verify that
								validation of the CRL fails.

								The evaluator shall modify any byte in the first eight bytes of the certificate and demonstrate that 
								the certificate fails to validate. (The certificate will fail to parse correctly.)

							<test>
								 The evaluator shall modify any byte in the last byte of the certificate and demonstrate that the 
								 certificate fails to validate. (The signature on the certificate will not validate.)
							</test>
							<test>
								The evaluator shall modify any byte in the public key of the certificate and demonstrate that the
								certificate fails to validate. (The signature on the certificate will not validate.)
							</test>
							<test>
								 (Conditional on support for EC certificates as indicated in FCS_COP.1/Sig). The evaluator shall establish a valid,
								 trusted certificate chain consisting of an EC leaf certificate, an EC Intermediate CA certificate not 
								 designated as a trust anchor, and an EC certificate designated as a trusted anchor, where the elliptic 
								 curve parameters are specified as a named curve. The evaluator shall confirm that the TOE validates 
								 the certificate chain.
							</test>
							<test>
								(Conditional on support for EC certificates as indicated in FCS_COP.1/Sig). The evaluator shall replace
								the intermediate certificate in the certificate chain for Test 9 with a modified certificate, where 
								the modified intermediate CA has a public key information field where the EC parameters uses an 
								explicit format version of the Elliptic Curve parameters in the public key information field of the
								intermediate CA certificate from Test 9, and the modified Intermediate CA certificate is signed by 
								the trusted EC root CA, but having no other changes. The evaluator shall confirm the TOE treats the
