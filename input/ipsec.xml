  <sec:Overview>
	Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a suite of open standards for ensuring private
	communications over public networks. It is typically used to encrypt Internet Protocol (IP) traffic 
	between hosts in a network and to create a virtual private network (VPN). 
	A VPN is a virtual network built on top of existing physical networks that provides a secure 
	communications mechanism for data and control information transmitted between computers or networks. 
	IPsec can also be used as a component that provides security for other
	internet protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). <h:p/> 
	The main components of IPsec are Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).
	ESP is the protocol used to to transport encrypted and integrity-protected 
	communications across the network.  IKE is the protocol used to set up and manage IPsec connections.
	<h:p/>
	This <h:i>Functional Package for IPsec</h:i> provides a collection of requirements and evaluation activities for
	IPSec implementations. The intent of this package is to provide PP, cPP, and PP-Module authors with a readily
	consumable collection of SFRs and EAs to be integrated into their documents. This Package can be used to 
	to evaluate the IPsec functionality of TOEs that are not themselves VPN clients. For example,
	it could be used to evaluate the trusted channel functionality of an operating system that chooses to 
	use IPsec rather than SSH or TLS to implement secure remote management. And of course, this Package 
	could be used to encapsulate the IPsec-specific requirements in a VPN technology evaluation as well.<h:p/>
	As such, this Package attempts to specify only requirements and evaluation activities for IPsec implementations
	as distinct from those for VPN implementations, such as VPN gateways and clients.

<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation	-->
<!--			-->
    <sec:toes title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
		The Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this Functional Package (FP) is an IT product that includes 
		an implementation of IPsec.  Typically this is a VPN client or VPN gateway - for which IPsec 
		functionality is fundamental. But the TOE could also be an operating system or other
		IT product for which IPsec functionality is ancillary. This FP describes the security 
		functionality of IPsec in terms of <xref g="CC"/>. 
		<h:p/>
		The contents of this FP must be appropriately incorporated into a PP, cPP, or PP-Module. When this Package 
		is so incorporated, the ST must include selection-based requirements in accordance with the selections or 
		assignments indicated in the incorporating document.
		<h:p/>
		The PP, cPP, or PP-Module that instantiates this Package must typically include the following components in order
		to satisfy dependencies of this Package. It is the responsibility of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module author who 
		incorporates this FP to ensure that dependence on these components is satisfied, either by the TOE or by 
		assumptions about its Operational Environment.
		<h:p>An ST must identify the applicable version of the PP, cPP, or PP-Module and this
		Functional Package in its conformance claims.</h:p>

<!--					When the TOE is a standalone software application, the IPsec functionality must be implemented by the
					TSF, though it is permissible for the TSF to invoke cryptographic algorithm services from the TOE
					platform to support the TOE’s implementation of IPsec. The TOE may also rely on the TOE platform for
					X.509 certificate validation services, though it is the responsibility of the TSF to take the proper action
					based on the validation response that is returned.<h:p/> -->
<!--					It is also permissible for the TSF to rely on low-level capabilities of the platform to perform enforcement
					and routing functions as a result of the policies the TSF maintains. For example, while the TSF must
					provide the capability to implement the Security Policy Database abstraction, it is allowed for the TSF to
					depend on the platform-provided network stack/driver to perform the low-level packet filtering and
					routing actions once the TSF has set up those rules as defined by the SPD.<h:p/>  -->
<!--					While enforcement of the IPsec requirements must be implemented by the TSF, it is permissible for the
					TSF to receive configuration of the IPsec behavior from an environmental source, most notably a VPN
					gateway. <h:p/>  -->
					<xref to="bibRFC4301"/> calls for an IPsec implementation to protect IP traffic through the use
					of a Security Policy Database (SPD). The SPD is used to define how IP packets are
					to be handled: PROTECT the packet (e.g., encrypt the packet), BYPASS the IPsec
					services (e.g., no encryption), or DISCARD the packet (e.g., drop the packet). The
					SPD can be implemented in various ways, including router access control lists,
					firewall rulesets, a "traditional" SPD, etc. Regardless of the implementation
					details, there is a notion of a "rule" that a packet is "matched" against and a
					resulting action that takes place.<h:p/>
					While there must be a means to order the rules, a general approach to ordering
					is not mandated, as long as the TOE can distinguish the IP packets and apply the
					rules accordingly. There may be multiple SPDs (one for each network interface)
					but this is not required.<h:p/>
<!-- Added -->		The SPD is established and populated by an administrative interface or application
					implemented by the entity that establishes the IPsec connection, such as a VPN gateway 
					or client application. This interface or application is outside the scope of this FP.<h:p/>
<!-- To replace					A VPN gateway fully implements the IPsec capability and provides an
					administrative interface to establish and populate an SPD. A VPN client is not
					required to provide an administrative interface to create or maintain an SPD.<h:p/>
					As an alternative, a client may provide an interface that can be used by another
					application or network entity, such as a VPN gateway, as a means to establish
					and populate the SPD. In either of these cases (the client provides an
					administrative interface, or an API), while the client is expected to maintain the
					SPD abstraction, it is permitted for the low-level enforcement and routing
					activities to be implemented by platform capabilities (e.g., a network driver) as
					configured by the client.   -->

						[VPN. the TOE is always an IPsec implementation. This is a VPN requirement.] In addition to the TSS EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the evaluator shall
						perform the following:<h:p/>
						If the TOE boundary includes a general-purpose operating system or mobile device, the evaluator

					</TSS>
					<Guidance>
						[VPN. The thing that configures the IPsec is outside the scope. This is a VPN thing] In addition to the Operational Guidance EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the
						evaluator shall perform the following:<h:p/>
						If the configuration of the IPsec behavior is from an environmental source, most notably a VPN gateway
						(e.g through receipt of required connection parameters from a VPN gateway), the evaluator shall ensure
						that the operational guidance contains any appropriate information for ensuring that this configuration
						can be properly applied.<h:p/>
						Note in this case that the implementation of the IPsec protocol must be enforced entirely within the TOE
						boundary; i.e. it is not permissible for a software application TOE to be a graphical front-end for IPsec
						functionality implemented totally or in part by the underlying OS platform. The behavior referenced here
						is for the possibility that the configuration of the IPsec connection is initiated from outside the TOE, which
						is permissible so long as the TSF is solely responsible for enforcing the configured behavior. However, it is
						allowable for the TSF to rely on low-level platform-provided networking functions to implement the SPD
						from the client (e.g., enforcement of packet routing decisions).<h:p/>
					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						As a prerequisite for performing the Test EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the
						evaluator shall do the following:<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall minimally create a test environment equivalent to the test environment illustrated
						below. It is expected that the traffic generator is used to construct network packets and will provide the
						evaluator with the ability manipulate fields in the ICMP, IPv4, IPv6, UDP, and TCP packet headers. The
						evaluator shall provide justification for any differences in the test environment.<h:p/>
						<figure entity="images/network.png" title="Test Environment" id="fig-testenv"/>
						Note that the evaluator shall perform all tests using the TOE and a representative sample of
						platforms listed in the ST (for TOEs that claim to support multiple platforms).
					</Tests>
				</aactivity>
				<aactivity level="element"> 
					<TSS>
						The evaluator shall examine the TSS and determine that it describes how the IPsec capabilities are
						implemented.<h:p/>
						<!-- If the TOE is a standalone software application, the evaluator shall ensure that the TSS asserts that all
						IPsec functionality is implemented by the TSF. --> The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS identifies any
						platform functionality the TSF relies upon to support its IPsec implementation, if any (e.g. does it invoke
						cryptographic primitive functions from the platform’s cryptographic library, enforcement of packet
						routing decisions by low-level network drivers).<h:p/>
<!--						If the TOE is part of a general-purpose desktop or mobile operating system, the evaluator shall ensure
						that the TSS describes at a high level the architectural relationship between the VPN client portion of the
						TOE and the rest of the TOE (e.g. is the VPN client an integrated part of the OS or is it a standalone
						executable that is bundled into the OS package). If the SPD is implemented by the underlying platform in
						this case, then the TSS describes how the client interacts with the platform to establish and populate the
						SPD, including the identification of the platform's interfaces that are used by the client.<h:p/>  -->		    
						In all cases, the evaluator shall also ensure that the TSS describes how the IPsec implementation <!--client--> interacts with the network
						stack of the platform(s) on which it can run (e.g., does the client insert itself within the stack via kernel
						mods, does the IPsec implementation<!--the client--> simply invoke APIs to gain access to network services).<h:p/>		   
						The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the SPD is implemented and the rules for processing
						both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. The TSS describes the rules that are
						available and the resulting actions available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how the available
						rules and actions form the SPD using terms defined in RFC 4301 such as BYPASS (e.g., no encryption),
						DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet) actions defined in RFC 4301.			  
						As noted in section 4.4.1 of RFC 4301, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and the evaluator
						shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to determine which rules will be applied given
						the rule structure implemented by the TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges,
						conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing (for both
						inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be applied, especially in the
						case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover both the initial packets (that is, no
						SA is established on the interface or for that particular packet) as well as packets that are part of an
						established SA. <h:p/>
					</TSS>    
					<Guidance>
						The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify that it describes how the SPD is created and
						configured. If there is an administrative interface to the IPsec implementation <!--client-->, then the guidance describes how the
						administrator specifies rules for processing a packet. The description includes all three cases - a rule that
						ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The
						evaluator shall determine that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the
						description in the TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to allow the
						administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion of how ordering of
						rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.<h:p/>
						If the <!--client-->IPsec implementation is configured by an external application, such as the VPN gateway, then the operational
						guidance should indicate this and provide a description of how IPsec <!--the client--> is configured by the external
						application. The description should contain information as to how the SPD is established and set up in an
						unambiguous fashion. The description should also include what is configurable via the external
						application, how ordering of entries may be expressed, as well as the impacts that ordering of entries may
						have on the packet processing.<h:p/>
						In either case, the evaluator ensures the description provided In the TSS is consistent with the capabilities
						and description provided in the operational guidance.<h:p/>
					</Guidance>
					<Tests>
						Depending on the implementation, the evaluator may be required to use a VPN gateway or some form of
						application to configure the client. For Test 2, the evaluator is required to choose an application that
						allows for the configuration of the full set of capabilities of the IPsec implementation <!--VPN client (in conjunction with the
						platform)-->. For example, if the IPsec implementation <!--client--> supports <!--provides a robust interface that allows for
						-->specification of wildcards,
						subnets, etc., it is unacceptable for the evaluator to <!--choose a VPN Gateway that allows--> specify only
						a single fully qualified IP addresses in the rule.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
						<testlist>
							<test>The evaluator shall configure an SPD <!--on the client -->that is capable of the following: dropping a
								packet, encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The selectors used in the

						<testlist>
							<test>The evaluator shall have the TOE generate a public-private key pair, and submit a CSR (Certificate
								Signing Request) to a CA (trusted by both the TOE and the peer VPN used to establish a connection) for
								its signature. The values for the DN (Common Name, Organization, Organizational Unit, and Country) will
								also be passed in the request. Alternatively, the evaluator may import to the TOE a previously generated

							</test>
							<test>The evaluator shall configure the TOE to use a private key and associated certificate signed by a
								trusted CA and shall establish an IPsec connection with the peer.                
							</test>
							<test>The evaluator shall test that the TOE can properly handle revoked certificates – conditional on
								whether CRL or OCSP is selected; if both are selected, and then a test is performed for each method. For
								this current version of the PP-Module, the evaluator has to only test one up in the trust chain (future
								drafts may require to ensure the validation is done up the entire chain). The evaluator shall ensure that a
								valid certificate is used, and that the SA is established. The evaluator then attempts the test with a
								certificate that will be revoked (for each method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate
								is no longer valid that the TOE will not establish an SA
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] For each selection made, the evaluator shall verify factors are required, as indicated in the
								operational guidance, to establish an IPsec connection with the server. 
							</test>
							For each supported identifier type (excluding DNs), the evaluator shall repeat the following tests:
							<test>For each field of the certificate supported for comparison, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the field in the peer’s
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds.
							</test>
							<test>For each field of the certificate support for comparison, the evaluator shall configure the peer’s
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to not match the field in the peer’s
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication fails.
							</test>
							The following tests are conditional:
							<test>[conditional] If, according to the TSS, the TOE supports both Common Name and SAN certificate
								fields and uses the preferred logic outlined in the Application Note, the tests above with the Common
								Name field shall be performed using peer certificates with no SAN extension. Additionally, the evaluator
								shall configure the peer’s reference identifier on the TOE to not match the SAN in the peer’s presented
								certificate but to match the Common Name in the peer’s presented certificate, and verify that the IKE
								authentication fails.
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports DN identifier types, the evaluator shall configure the peer's
								reference identifier on the TOE (per the administrative guidance) to match the subject DN in the peer's
								presented certificate and shall verify that the IKE authentication succeeds. To demonstrate a bit-wise
								comparison of the DN, the evaluator shall change a single bit in the DN (preferably, in an Object Identifier
								(OID) in the DN) and verify that the IKE authentication fails. <h:b>To demonstrate a comparison of DN values,
								the evaluator shall change any one of the four DN values and verify that the IKE authentication fails.</h:b>
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] If the TOE supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and supports IP address identifier types, the
								evaluator must repeat test 1 and 2 with both IPv4 address identifiers and IPv6 identifiers. Additionally,
								the evaluator shall verify that the TOE verifies that the IP header matches the identifiers by setting the
								presented identifiers and the reference identifier with the same IP address that differs from the actual IP
								address of the peer in the IP headers and verifying that the IKE authentication fails.
							</test>
							<test>[conditional] If, according to the TSS, the TOE performs comparisons between the peer’s ID
								payload and the peer’s certificate, the evaluator shall repeat the following test for each combination of
								supported identifier types and supported certificate fields (as above). The evaluator shall configure the
								peer to present a different ID payload than the field in the peer’s presented certificate and verify that the
								TOE fails to authenticate the IKE peer.
